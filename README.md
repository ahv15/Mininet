The project is built on top of the POX controller which is used to block the flow of packets in an SDN by updating the rules in a flow table. The ML algorithm is used to classify packets and using the prediction done by the alogorithm malicious sources are identified and can be used to block those devices in an SDN which can be used to simulate trafiic on a virtual network.
